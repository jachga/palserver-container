My personal Dockerfile (no extra scripts) that will download and run a PalWorld dedicated server.

Currently works, using the official instructions from th PalWorld developers to get past a steam.so error.

Game folder is a volume on `/game/`, and I left it to the server runner to change the game port (and other settings) in the respective configuration files (rather than have the CMD set the game port).

I build it with:
```
sudo podman build --tag palserver .
```

and I run it with:
```
sudo podman run -d --name palserver -p 8211:8211/udp -v ~/palserver/:/game/:Z localhost/palserver:latest
```
